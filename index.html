<p>Hey ponies, welcome to my internet blog. <br> <br>
  I see you've been coming to the offline chat so I'll mention some things I've been up to. <br>
  I haven't been drawing a lot, almost at all. My drawing skills probably deteriorated quite a bit. 
  But I've been nonstop busy with other interesting things and that's why.
  I've learned a good chunk of C++ I think. I got all the basics down at least things such as pointers, arrays, vectors, structures, etc. <br>
  I've also spent about a week worth of time memorizing new kanji and vocabulary. It feels like I made another leap forward in Japanese studies just from that
  but more on that later. <br>
  I also wrote a kickass song probably about 2 weeks ago. Maybe I'll put a link to it at the end of this wall of text. 
  When I started learning C++ about 3 weeks ago I made a simple turn based game, I started adding things like leveling up and all sorts of stats and so I got
  this fantasy of making a console game so I came up with some characters and made a very small character sheet and then wrote a song for it as well, however today
  I started learning DirectX so I'm not sure if I'll make that console game anymore. Anyways, in case I do actually make the game, I shouldn't reveal too much about it
  <br> <br>
  So I've been studying and working on stuff all day every day since I left, almost. <br>
  I had an unbroken streak until 2 (or maybe it was 3) days ago. My past week or week and a half has been fully focused on studying Japanese. I got myself a list
  of all 2500 common kanji and put them in a notepad and started reviewing all the kanji that I don't recognize one by one. I managed to learn about 6 or 7 dozen kanji
  and probably about 300 words or so. Now I'm reviewing them every day to retain that knowledge. But I should speak of the matter that broke my month long learning
  streak. <br>
  Having learned as much kanji and vocabulary as I have mentioned, I was eager to see how those things look when applied in natural context.
  Futaba is a bit slow. I like the 2nd "二次元裏" (translation: 2D Alternative (as in alternative version)) board and sometimes there is good reading material there
  but it's very slow and it's mostly been getting raided by some guy for some weeks or god knows how long (don't they have mods? I don't know.). <br>
  So you might see where this is going, I looked up Japanese social browser games and I thought reading the rules, mechanics, story, etc. would be an
  amazing exercise and... it actually was. Lot of the kanji and even the specific words that I had just learned appeared many times and my understanding was way 
  better than it would've been prior to that. And I learned a lot of new words and kanji due to it as well, there is a world chat where people talk about daily things
  with each other and it is slow enough that it can be fully read so I spent couple hours just there, reading other people's conversations and leaving notes on things
  I couldn't read. However, it is a shit game. It seems like a new gacha game or something and I joined exactly on the first day a new server had opened and right off
  the bat I got in top 100ish players in rank. So I got a little hooked on it for 2 days, but I think it's already worn off mostly, today I spent all day learning again.
  Now since you've read this entire shitpost and as an apology for wasting 2 (or 3) days here is my song demo that I made: https://files.catbox.moe/0qt7wo.mp3
