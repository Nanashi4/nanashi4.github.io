  Hey, <br>
  I don't have too much to say. <br>
  Situation at home got a little more complicated again, but I think it will all turn out fine as always. <br>
  Due to it, however, I haven't studied much recently, except for Japanese. I practice that every day, always. <br><br>
  
  I'm afraid I might have some complications with my hearing, I've completely avoided listening to any audio since about the last time I posted that audio file in chat,
  however since then my tinnitus, which is undiagnosed yet, has only gotten worse, and I'm having all sorts of fucked up things with my ears. I am scheduled to visit a
  doctor the next month. I hope my ears will be alright until then. <br>
  I wish I could listen to my favorite songs right now, I hope my ears will get better and the doctor will help me. But I am not very confident in that. <br><br>
  
  I mentioned that I will come back in February, I think it might be late February, but I will make sure that I have some nice things to show off at that time. <br><br>
  </p>
