This webpage is currently under construction as I'm slowly learning how to construct and design it.
The purpose of this webpage once it's done will be to teach Japanese language with main focus on
memorizing vocabulary and Kanji.<p> 
<p style="color: #ff9374">Your teachers will be a variety of adorable "moe" characters and
they will try their best to make sure that you're not slacking with your studies! The days of taking it
easy are over, the "moe" school will not have any mercy for those who procastrinate!
<p>
<p style="color: #ff76a5">As this is the "moe" school it would be appropriate for the first word covered to be... 萌え(moe).
That is how we will be referring to "moe" from now on. It means falling in love with a fictional character, especially from
anime and manga. It is written with a Kanji which can mean "to sprout" or "to bud". I will go in more detail once the page is done! <p>
<p style="color: #ff9374">
It is uncertain when the webpage will be ready but I'll try to do it within a few months. I'll see you in the classroom!
