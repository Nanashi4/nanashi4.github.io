    Friend 1: Hey, what are you doing?

Chichi: Huh..? AH! Ahhh! N-n-nothing!!! Nothing in particular!!!!

Friend 1: "Hmmmm..." *stares* "Your expression says otherwise."

Chichi: "I don't know what you're talking about!"

Friend 1: You were looking at something on your phone, right?

Chichi: "N-n... yes..."

Friend 1: "What were you looking at?"

Chichi: "Nothing..."

Friend 1: "Do you really think you can fool me that easily? I'm disappointed."

Chichi: "I'm sorry"

Friend 1: "Don't worry, I'll forget about it if you let me see what you were looking at! :D" *grins*

Chichi: *pouts* "You're so cruel..."

Chichi: "O-okay, here..." *shows the phone*

Friend1: "Haaah!? 'Magical girl Rabi-chan', seriously? I didn't know you were interested into that sort of stuff"

Chichi: "I'm not!! I mean... actually... I... want to become a magical girl."

Friend 1: "A magical girl!?"

Chichi: "Don't say it so loud! ...yes, I want to become a magical girl but don't tell any-"

Friend 1: "Hey guys, come over here! Chichi says she wants to become a magical girl!"

Friend 2 & 3: "What, really?"

Friend 2: "Chichi-chan, you want to become a magical girl, that is so cute"

Friend 3: "Haha, I wasn't expecting to hear that"

Friend 1: "I know, right? Me neither."

Chichi: "Friend 1-chan you weren't supposed to tell anyone, this is so embarassing." (-_-')

Friend 1: "Hehe gomen, gomen! I thought it would be funny."

Friend 3: "Say, Chichi-chan why do you want to become a magical girl?"

Chichi: Umm... I want to... I want to become a magical girl because magical girls are so pretty and they always save others from trouble!

Friend 2: "Ah, Chichi-chan, you're so adorable <3"

Friend 1: "That is pretty cool, hey I know! I'll help you become a magical girl. I read a little bit about it and it seems fun."

Friend 1: "Also as a little bit of a payback for leaking your secret out."

Friend 3: "I want to help too!"

Chichi:"Really!? You guys are the BEST! Thank you so much!"

???:*fufufu*

*silence*

Chichi:"Who are you?" *says with determination*

???:"You can never become a magical girl."

Chichi:"!"

Rival-chan:"You can never become a magical girl because... I AM GOING TO BECOME A MAGICAL GIRL!!!

Chichi:"What!? That can't be true! why do you think you can become a magical girl?

Rival-chan:"Oh my... you want me to show you?" *fufufu*

Rival-chan:"Fine, I will allow you to see... just this once... why you can NEVER become a magical girl"

Rival-chan: *braces her hand behind her back*

*tension builds up*

Everyone: *whisper* "What is she going to do?" "I don't know"

Chichi: *gulp*

Rival-chan: "ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS!!!"

Everyone: "HAAAAAH!?!?!?"

Friend 1: "Do you think rock paper scissors proves anything, it's a game of luck you idiot."

Rival-chan: "I'm not an IDIOT!!!" *grrrr*

Rival-chan: "A real magical girl would never lose at something as insignificant as a game of rock paper scissors! That's why you will fight me and I will show you who the real magical girl is!"

Friend 1: "Let's just ignore her"

Rival-chan: "HEY!"

Chichi: "It's fine, it must be true. A real magical girl could never lose at something like rock, paper scissors... I will accept your challenge!"

Rival-chan: "Hmph, I see you finally got some courage, but that won't be enough!"

Rival-chan: (*fufufu* "they don't know that today is my lucky day, I read that in a horoscope before school this morning. This will be a piece of cake")

Chichi: "So are you ready?"

Rival-chan: "Huh uh... Yeah! I am going to win now, prepare yourself!"

Rival-chan: "If you're scared, it's still okay to give up. After all, I won't be holding back."

Chichi: "Hmph! We will see about that! (I must not lose, this is my first trial on the path to becoming a magical girl!)"

Rival-chan: "Okay then, here we go. (HEHE, I almost feel bad for her. At least if she gave up I wouldn't have to embarass her in front of everybody.)"

Chichi & Rival-chan: "ROCK... PAPER...... SCISSORS!!!

Rival-chan: *rock*

Chichi: *paper*

Rival-chan: *scissors*

Chichi: "Hey that's cheating!"

Rival-chan: "N-no it's not! My hand moved on it's own!" (gah, how could I lose!? It is supposed to be my lucky day!)

Rival-chan: "If anything it's proof that I am the real magical girl!"

Chichi: *gigi* -.-*

Friend 1: "Don't listen to her, she obviously cheated."

Rival-chan: "HEY, I didn't cheat!"

Chichi: "I know she cheated but..."

Rival-chan: (Tch, this is bad they're ignoring me and they know that I cheated. I need to get out of this situation somehow.)

Rival-chan: "AH!.."

Everyone:"Huh...?"

Rival-chan: "HO~ HO~ HO~, it seems today is your lucky day. I have some unfinished magical girl busniness to take care of so I won't be able to show you my full power yet, consider yourself VERY lucky this time!"

Rival-chan: "BYE-BYE"

Rival-chan: (I think that was a good save, I'll have to eat in the school bathroom this time)

Rival-chan: *leaves*

Everyone: "She left..."
